# cudablurhash

Implementation of [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) encoder that runs on CUDA.

Blurhash takes an image and encodes it into short string, that can be later decoded into a blurry placeholder for an image.
It solves the problem of ugly white boxes that wait for the image to be downloaded and instead displays something reminiscent of a loading photo at instance.

More information about Blurhash and examples can be seen [on it's GitHub](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash).
